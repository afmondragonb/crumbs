# Crumbs
Custom lettering for a logo used in Upperquad's game, Crumbskees.

Lettering is based loosely on Antique Olive and Nord, and meant to be displayed alongside Dinamo's Ginto Nord (used in the game's UI and design).

VERSION HISTORY

Alpha AA 
Establishing general weights, modulations, and proportions and trying to establish an aesthetic that allows the lettering to sit alongside GInto Nord without overlapping too much stylistically.

Alpha AB
Incorporated preliminary feedback from Graham Bradley (roxaboxen.com)

As the game illustration is increasingly becoming more stylized and "cartoon-ish" the lettering has started to push the boundaries of its construction to achieve a friendlier and more naive style using rounder shapes, more angled terminals, and moving away from fully straight verticals in favor of concave edges.

Proportions are still being tweaked to optically balance the letterforms.

Counterforms are still needing tweaks.
